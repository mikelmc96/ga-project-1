# Goals

* Provide students practice for their talent fair at the end of the course
* Teach students how to quickly, and consisely convey their project on a high
  level
* Encourage student to student interaction regarding their projects

# Format

2 sessions of presenting are used. Per session:

* 13 students presenting, 13 students viewing
* Each presenter shares their project for 5min per person
* Every 5min viewers rotate to the next presenter
* Format above continues until all 13 presenters have shown their project to
  each viewer
* Viewers and Presenters switch rolls; repeat the steps above.

Each session should be ~1hr 10min long.

__Remember!__ This is a practice for your professional talent show at the end
of the course. Ask and answer questions as if you were talking to your next
employer. Please don't debug your code during the presentations.

# Rotation Instructions

## Interview Questions

Each viewer will ask the presenter the following questions (this shouldn't take
more than 2.5min):

* What was your biggest struggle with the project and what did you do to
  overcome this?
* Describe, in a high level, how your code works. (Don't just state the
  frameworks used). For example. "I used a series of classes to model the
  question cards, users, and game process".
* Who are your shoutouts? (Aside from IAs and instructors). (Shoutout being
  someone who you would like to credit giving you help or moral support during
  the project).

## Game Demo

The presenter should demo the game as well as answer the questions above. 

If the game demo is broken _don't worry!_ Talk about why it's broken and go
deeper in explaining the architecture.
